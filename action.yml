    required: false
    default: 'update/'
  skip_versioned_revisions:
    description: 'If `true`, will cause the action to skip updating any dependency that has a version in their revision. This is due to the way niv currently works, where it will always update to the latest HEAD of a branch. Thus, if one have a dependency where, for example, `rev=v1.0.0`, niv would normally update it to the latest head of the branch, making `rev` holding the appropriate SHA. This is something one would not normally expect. Thus, this option exists until niv fixes the behaviour. Defaults to `true`.'
